# World-Terrorism-Data-Dashboard

Project Objective:
Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize global terrorism trends, helping users explore patterns, regional impact, and historical insights.

Technologies and Libraries Used:  

Python Libraries :  

         NumPy & Pandas : For numerical computations and data wrangling (e.g. cleaning missing values, aggregating datasets).

         Matplotlib : To create static visualizations and explore correlations in data.

         Plotly.graph_objects : For dynamic and interactive charts.

Dash Framework:  

         Dash, dcc, html :To build and structure the dashboard.

         dash_bootstrap_components(dbc): For responsive and visually appealing UI design.

         webbrowser: Automatically open the dashboard in the default web browser.

  Key Dashboard Features:  

        Interactive Graphs and Charts:

               Bar Graphs: Analyze the number of attacks by country and year.

               Line Charts: Track terrorism trends over time.

               Pie Chart:  Distribution of Target types.

               Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between variables (e.g., wounded vs killed year wise ).

               Histograms: Visualize frequency distributions (e.g. number of attacks per year).

              Sunburst Charts: Drill down into hierarchical data (e.g. region > attack type). 

      Filters and Interactivity:  

             Allows users to filter data by year, region, attack type, and target group dynamically. 

             Hover and zoom features for detailed data exploration.  

  Outcomes: 

          Provides actionable insights into global terrorism patterns, assisting researchers and policymakers in understanding critical trends.
